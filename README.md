# sentiment-analysis-hotel-reviews
 Build a model to analyze customer sentiment from hotel reviews (positive, neutral, or negative).


### Dataset 
URL: [TripAdvisor Hotel Reviews on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/joebeachcapital/hotel-reviews) 
The folder contains:
- `offering.txt`
- `offerings.csv`
- `review.txt`
- `reviews.csv`


In my **`main.py`**, only `offerings.csv` and `reviews.csv` are used.


(Note: In this repository, ignore `review.txt` and `reviews.csv` due to Git LFS limitations. xD)
