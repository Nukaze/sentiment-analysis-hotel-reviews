My husband and I stayed at this hotel from June 3rd to June 8th. It was a wonderful experience. The location was great near everything. The staff was excellent. Although the room was small, King room , it was very clean and comfortable. We purchased an unlimited travel pass at Walgreen's which was located right up the street from the hotel. We used it the whole time we were there. We rode the trolley and buses unlimited. They all stopped right at the corner down the street from the hotel. We walked to shopping area which was a very short walk. The Hotel was just great and I would recommend it to anyone. The price was right. Every evening we had the complimentary glass of wine sitting in the bar/library area. It was very cozy and lovely. What a great touch. If you are planning a trip to San Francisco definitely consider this find. You will love it.","{'username': 'Judym1220', 'num_reviews': 1, 'id': 'A78C4221D9F7843A3491672B7CE85A51', 'location': 'Brooklyn, New York', 'num_helpful_votes': 1}",2007-06-01,112307,1,2007-06-29,8025601,False,5.0

The subway was just over the street and we could walk to Central Park within 30 minutes. 
The reception staff were very friendly and gave us lots of advice about how to get around the city and what to see and when. 
A nice touch was the iced tea in reception every afternoon. As it was in the 80's we were very grateful for a nice cool drink when we returned to the hotel. Coffee and tea were available in the morning. There were computers to use free of charge, useful for looking up restaurants etc.
The rooms were a good size, 2 double beds in each. The bathroom had a huge wet room/walk in shower and there were plenty of free toiletries to use. The bathrobe came in handy as well!
All in all a very good hotel in an excellent location for all the sights.","{'username': 'lulu1963', 'num_cities': 7, 'num_helpful_votes': 6, 'num_reviews': 7, 'num_type_reviews': 6, 'id': 'BFFC7E8700FC9130D29B74F1AF234F2C', 'location': 'East Sussex'}",2012-04-01,1503474,1,2012-05-18,130164900,False,5.0

Will definitely go back there when in San Diego next time. 
Only parking got a bit full due to concert nearby since it wasn't just for hotel guests.
Also pet friendly and enjoyed watching all different types of dogs roaming around.","{'username': 'Arizona03', 'num_cities': 5, 'num_helpful_votes': 12, 'num_reviews': 10, 'num_type_reviews': 3, 'id': '42A44FB799B3FE9EF3D1B9FF6FCAAB7A', 'location': 'Tucson'}",2011-07-01,1011240,5,2011-07-05,115069002,False,5.0

We had an issue with the reservation that my Girlfriend arrived the night before I did. After a few phone calls the staff sorted the problem out, excellent customer service manager helped alot.
No Wifi in the rooms on the 7th floor, therefore no iPhone.
There is a sports bar, buts its pricy.
The area around the hotel is a little remote, but I was having meeting near the airport so it suited fine.
Great breakfast, did not try evening meals, we always went out.
Ok for an overnight stay if you need to be near the airport, next time I am going to try a little furthur away and nearer civilisation.
Quite a lot of Aircraft noise, but this is no surprise as its so close to the runway. But its kind of fun watching the plane take off and land!!","{'username': 'westburykid', 'num_cities': 9, 'num_helpful_votes': 7, 'num_reviews': 18, 'num_type_reviews': 9, 'id': '920B3DCFCB2CADBADF96FA216A8C9AAA', 'location': 'Stoke on Trent'}",2010-04-01,112137,0,2010-05-18,64494515,False,3.0
