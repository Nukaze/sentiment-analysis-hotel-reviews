“A Welcome Refuge”,"I have never experienced a more caring, accommodating hotel...and I used to be a meeting planner who was constantly spoiled by hotels all over the world! My husband and I were vacationing in Colorado when he was in a horseback riding accident. He was taken to Swedish Hospital in Denver. We did not know anyone in Denver...and had no idea whether or not he was facing surgery or being released in the evening. We had arrived at the hospital by ambulance from 2 hours away. Suddenly, I panicked realizing that if he were dismissed (our sincere hope)...we had no car, no knowledge of the area, and no place to go. 
He was released with a concssion and the need to rest until our friends could drive to Denver the next day and get us to the airport to travel back to the East Coast. The Denver Marriott Tech Center came to the rescue in GRAND fashion! They sent a shuttle to the hospital, had a very nice room waiting for us at a great price, gave us a very late check out the next day and even extended a discount on all food and beverages. EVERY single hotel employee seemed to have our best interest at heart. After all the stress we have endured, it was like being with friends and family. 
The hotel is lovely...but in this case, it was their heart that really spoke the loudest. I would stay there again and again. To find a hotel with such a caring attitude is more refreshing than I can ever express. 
And yes...even if you are not there under extreme circumstances, you will find this hotel extremely nice, the food delicious and the experience great.","{'username': 'KalamityK', 'num_cities': 13, 'num_helpful_votes': 15, 'num_reviews': 30, 'num_type_reviews': 8, 'id': '81A94276029E846024099E4BDE0EAE6C', 'location': 'Richmond, VA'}",,120083,1,2012-09-13,140187524,False,5.0,"“A Welcome Refuge” I have never experienced a more caring, accommodating hotel...and I used to be a meeting planner who was constantly spoiled by hotels all over the world!

“Stay hotel is vile.”,"Please save yourself the $300+/ night and stay at a Holiday Inn or maybe even a park bench. I have never received such poor customer service in my entire existence. I was enraged with the employees who worked at Stay. These imbeciles need to be educated on how to treat patrons. I am still fuming thinking about all the lame excuses these people spewed out. Let me just fill you in on my first day at Stay...I step in the room and think 'wow, my bathroom at home is larger than this'. Then I search for the bathroom and see that it is half the size of a Smart Car...I was speechless. I move on and use the restroom. I flush and flush and flush and my urine won't flush away. I call for a plumber and the front desk says that someone will be right up. I leave for the day and think that by the time I get back to the room (12 hours later) that the toilet would have already been fixed...I thought wrong. I call again and I get some guy screaming into the mic because the club downstairs is blasting music. He tells me someone will come right up and then the waiting game began. While i waited, I discovered that not only did the toilet not work, but the shower did not either. I tried to get hot water but no hot water would trickle down the pipes...I stopped waiting & realized that i was never going to get someone to fix these things & I jump in to the cold water.By that time, it was 230 am and i was taking a cold shower and pissing in a toilet that would not flush. I get out of the shower, and someone finally comes to fix this mess. He tells me that I need to turn the hot water knob on in the sink, let it run until it gets hot, read a magazine for 30 min, & then turn on the hot water knob in the shower and let that run the same way i let the faucet run...did you get all of that??? Neither did I!!!
So here is the run down :1st, the toilet was broken, then i was forced to take a cold shower (because STAY hotel does not provide their guests with hot water...yes, you read that correctly, NO HOT WATER), and to top it all off, when i finally get into bed i find that my bedsheets are riddled with yellow stains of an unknown origin.

“Outstanding Hotel in a Fantastic Location”,"I can’t say enough great things about the XV Beacon. The location was in a beautiful area of Beacon Hill, the staff was outstanding and the rooms were beautiful. One incredible benefit is the Lexus car service that is offered at no charge by the hotel. It was a great way to get around the city to see various things without having to worry about finding a cab (Thanks Mark for driving us around)!","{'username': 'CRAdventures', 'num_cities': 4, 'num_helpful_votes': 5, 'num_reviews': 10, 'num_type_reviews': 4, 'id': '78AC0699523B451BAF4354988CAA9168', 'location': 'Dallas, Texas'}",,94337,3,2012-08-20,137743849,False,5.0,"“Outstanding Hotel in a Fantastic Location” I can’t say enough great things about the XV Beacon.

“really enjoyed our ZAZA stay”,"The hotel has a fun, funky vibe, but not so much so that it feels weird. The service is first rate - extremely attentive. I traveled with my 16 year old and 6 year old, and both really enjoyed just being at the hotel. Something about the place just makes you feel cool. We did have room service once and I thought the fees added to the bill were exorbitant, so beware there. Also, the restaurant is worth a visit, if for no other reason than it's such a cool place. I found the dinner a better meal there than lunch. We would definitely stay here again.","{'username': 'takeatrip6', 'num_cities': 2, 'num_helpful_votes': 1, 'num_reviews': 2, 'location': 'Lafayette, LA', 'id': 'D14A04635F47C7F997B9B90E598DE7DD'}",,641273,0,2009-08-06,36866436,False,5.0,"“really enjoyed our ZAZA stay” The hotel has a fun, funky vibe, but not so much so that it feels weird.

"“McCormick on business, or just need to be close in”","I was amazed. When I travel to inner city Chicago, I am used to paying high prices, getting questionable service, and getting nailed for parking. A couple of weeks ago I stumbled onto this great hotel. First, it's in an area of town that just 5 years ago would be dangerous - but Chicago is changing - I felt 100% safe the whole time.
This is a brand new building, a brand new hotel - great rooms, some of the friendliest service I have ever enjoyed. From Todd the manager on down, everone seemed to care about whether I was comfortable. Parking is free - and its right outside the door of the hotel not down the corner and around the block.
The place is 6 blocks from McCormick West - I walked it a couple of time. Or a $4.00 cab ride - I got lazy one afternoon. It's walking distance to Chinatown (3 blocks). 
If there is a bad part its this - this is not a loop hotel. If you want to see the loop, do restaurants etc, you will probably need a cab or drive. However, with parking hovering at 30-40 dollars a night, the free parking will cover you cab ride.
All in all, I am recommending this place to all my friends.","{'username': 'Frank H', 'num_cities': 42, 'num_helpful_votes': 42, 'num_reviews': 72, 'num_type_reviews': 47, 'id': '971D7915AB724B17C31847CB07C31CBC', 'location': 'Davenport, Iowa'}",,1075753,0,2010-10-08,82586363,False,5.0,"“McCormick on business, or just need to be close in” I was amazed.
