“Un motel nella media”,"Questo hotel, situato tra west holliwood e beverly hills non ci ha particolarmente colpito. Rispecchia bene tante parti di los angeles, che brillano di uno splendore che non c'è più...E' un hotel un pò decadente, che sicuramente se fosse rimesso in sesto attirerebbe un numero maggiore di ospiti. La pulizia non era il massimo, il bagno stava in piedi ma non era curato. Pensare che alcune finiture se rimesse a lucido potrebbero essere anche di lusso..sembra uno di quegli hotel anni '50 in cui una volta andavano i divi mentre ora è un pò lasciato a se stesso. Il personale è gentile ma non efficiente...E' gestito da cinesi che parlano male inglese e questo rende la comuncazione un pò difficile. Il punto di forza di questo hotel è il parcheggio che costa 8dollari al giorno, anche se a dire il vero il garage è davvero piccolo e stretto!! Altra pecca la pulizia...non eccelsa..abbiamo anche trovato un capello nel frigorifero!! Probabilmente se tornassi a LA sceglierei un altro hotel..magari più nella zona di Santa Monica Boulevard o nel cuore di holliwood!!","{'username': 'Grecia81', 'num_cities': 44, 'num_helpful_votes': 18, 'num_reviews': 76, 'num_type_reviews': 30, 'id': '9C94B6792822786E40EAA6DAE4390A29', 'location': 'Romagna'}",,82578,0,2011-09-03,117622670,False,3.0,"“Un motel nella media” Questo hotel, situato tra west holliwood e beverly hills non ci ha particolarmente colpito.

“Best in NYC!!”,My husband and I have been to NYC 10 or 12 times and have stayed in different hotels or apts. each time. The Staybridge Suites is at the very top of the list of ones we would stay at again. The rooms are comfortable and so clean and the staff is unbelievable!! We have never been treated so well - Sunny even offered us his table at a restaurant!! And they would even go down the block to find us a cab! A+ treatment!! The breakfast was great and what a treat to have snacks (actually could have been dinner!!) and drinks on Tuesday-Thursday evenings! We'll definitely stay there again.,"{'username': 'SusanJohn44', 'num_reviews': 1, 'id': 'D5529A1787656FBF711710FA12DC2DE0', 'location': 'Texas'}",,1465162,0,2010-10-18,83947479,False,5.0,“Best in NYC!!” My husband and I have been to NYC 10 or 12 times and have stayed in different hotels or apts. each time.

“Rims & Tires Stolen!!”,"We chose this hotel as it was close to Hobby, however that was only good point. Upon arrival we noticed it was in a bad area since entire hotel is surrounded by iron fence with key entry gate. I booked the park & fly room rates to leave my vehicle for our flight. The staff even made me move my Cadillac Escalade to the first parking spot 20' directly at the front entrance under security light. Upon return to the hotel we noticed that our rear two rims & tires were stolen. Really!! Right under their noses and directly in line of site from the booking counters, the staff indicated no one saw anything. To make matters worse, we were stranded with absolutely no help from the staff and was told they were not going to pay for anything or even consider reimbursement for my stay. Told it was pretty much my problem....Thank God for onstar otherwise I would still be sitting in their gated parking lot with my entire family and bags in hand. If you want good advice choose another hotel!!!!!","{'username': 'kajuntwin', 'num_cities': 2, 'num_helpful_votes': 2, 'num_reviews': 2, 'location': 'Louisiana', 'id': '813CE2D8B916B4C3CFD8820ED7879FCD'}",,108150,1,2012-05-27,130672407,False,1.0,"“Rims & Tires Stolen!!” We chose this hotel as it was close to Hobby, however that was only good point.

“Ein schönes Hotel in sehr guter Lage”,"Das Chambers Hotel liegt sehr günstig zwischen der 5. und 6. Ave. in der 56th. Straße. Zur U-Bahn (56th Street) sind es nur wenige Schritte.
 Der Empfang war sehr freundlich und zuvorkommend. Wir fühlten uns vom ersten Augenblick als Gast willkommen. Unser Zimmer war im 4. Stock mit Blick auf die 56th Straße und das Rockefeller Center. Da es sehr heiß war, haben wir das Fenster nicht geöffnet. Wir haben auch nichts vom Verkehr oder ähnlichen mitbekommen. Das Zimmer war riesig. Das schöne und vor allem helle Bad war auch sehr angenehm. Das Hotel verfügte über kostenloses Wi-Fi. Der ging auch ohne Probleme im ganzen Hotel. Das Hotelfrühstück ist a la carte und sehr gut. In unmittelbarer Nähe gibt es aber genug Alternativen.
Überhaupt die Lage ist für einen New York Aufenthalt sehr praktisch. Der Central Park (unbedingt ein Fahrrad ausleihen und eine große Runde durch den Park drehen) und die 5. Avenue mit ihren unzähligen Einkaufsmöglichkeiten sind gleich ums Eck. 
Wir haben unseren Aufenthalt sehr genossen und werden bei unseren nächsten NY Aufenthalt wieder hier übernachten.","{'username': 'Camparispezial', 'num_cities': 30, 'num_helpful_votes': 5, 'num_reviews': 30, 'num_type_reviews': 29, 'id': '9F2191E43E562016B9A076073433AB36', 'location': 'Chiemgau'}",,157057,0,2010-09-25,80936837,False,5.0,"“Ein schönes Hotel in sehr guter Lage” Das Chambers Hotel liegt sehr günstig zwischen der 5. und 6.

“How can a remodel make a hotel worse?”,"The low quality level of remodels in the current environment is exemplified by the Grand Hyatt in New York. This is a hotel I have stayed in before and I have come to accept that with the exception of some of the more boutiqe style hotels , staying in NY means you have to compromise. 
 However for a 5 star hotel anywhere in the world I DO expect room service 24 hours - yes after midnight I dont expect the full menu but I want to see something - there is nothing at all after 11pm Secondly I dont expect to have to wait for 20 minutes to check in at 930pm at night. I also expect super fast laundry but the Grand Hyatt doesnt even do it during the weekend at all and all services are day service there is no emergency overnight - also there is no tailor which is disappointing.
 The remodel itself has put automated lights with finger touch controls that are a complete pain to work and need a lot of finessing - als there are only 2 settings , bright and soft but that applys to all the lights - there is not a muliti area control. There is an ipod dock that is okay but not that impressive and there is no dvd player
There is no minibar just an empty fridge but the worst is the bathroom remodelling
 The remodelling of the bathrooms now put - no not a walkin shower which might be nice , but an attempt at a semi rainforest shower attatcment ot the old tubs. However it is clear that whoever fitted this was less competent than I am - and i am not exagerating at all you can still see the marks where the old controls were and there are two gaping holes there as well as a broken control. Frankly the bathrooms would have been better at their old selves because at least those worked - this one came apart in my hand. The shower head was also not very effective becuase its not a proper rainforest head - it comes at a 45 degree angle through to around 10 degrees;
 Overall they should have forgotten the remodel and maybe just spruced up the fixtusres and fittings a bit even the floor upgrade looks like it will look terrible after just a couple of years.
 The staff also are not particularly helpful with housekeeping waking me up at 7am - I am sorry but i dont expect housekeeping to be cleaning rooms at 7am for a room that has not been checked out of - wether i work on wall street or main street I dont expect them to come in at that time - partly its a problem that these is no push button for do not disturb (given all the new gagetry the one USEFUL thing they could have done wasnt there)
 Location is great , but the hotel is a disaster - this put me off other Grand Hyatts elsewhere... its not the worst hotel I have stayed it but probably the worst that cost more than 300 dollars a night - compate this to any grand hyatt in asia and you will have a heart attack.","{'username': 'CurlyHongKong', 'num_cities': 9, 'num_helpful_votes': 58, 'num_reviews': 16, 'num_type_reviews': 16, 'id': '3CCB47DB6F7204221F722293F96861E4', 'location': 'Hong Kong'}",,93450,4,2012-10-18,143117386,False,1.0,"“How can a remodel make a hotel worse?” The low quality level of remodels in the current environment is exemplified by the Grand Hyatt in New York.
