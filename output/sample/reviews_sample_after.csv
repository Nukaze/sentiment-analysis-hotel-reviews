“Girls inLA”,"For 4 nights we had two rooms, top floor. Pool was beautful, ambience was nice. The motel staff was very helpful and accomodating. Aire conditioning was loud but put us to sleep. Bathroom was fine-just shower (no tub my lil one wasn't a happy camper.) Towels were thin but worked fine. Blow drier-thank god!! Washed laundry; also had computer and microwave in common room. Perfect spot to sleep and shower and relax. Close to many attractions and eats. We had a car (free paring) so anywhere we wanted to go-30 minutes due to traffic. But perfect.","{'username': 'may2004bride', 'num_cities': 8, 'num_helpful_votes': 3, 'num_reviews': 13, 'num_type_reviews': 5, 'id': '262AAE0F680567F28144D20F19470B8F', 'location': 'Staten Island'}",,133994,1,2012-07-23,135177835,False,4.0,"“Girls inLA” For 4 nights we had two rooms, top floor.

“Bien ubicado pero muy ruidoso”,"No es un hotel barato
Dentro de lo positivo el hotel queda muy bien ubicado a una cuadra del Central Park, y caminable totalmente al Time Square. Las habitacion eran limpia y agradable. El personal era correcto, no muy amable pero tampoco preocupado. Tiene microondas y refrigerador lo que ayuda bastante para comprar cosas y mantenerlas
 El baño tambien esta dentro de lo esperable en tamaño y limpieza. el unico punto en contra es el ruido, las ventanas no son termo panel y el ruido es toda la noche, luego de caminar todo el dia y salir por la noche, en lo personal es dificil descansar si eres de de sueño liviano. La habitacion nuestra daba a la calle por lo que es posible que las que den al interior sean algo menos ruidosas.","{'username': 'camg30', 'num_cities': 7, 'num_helpful_votes': 1, 'num_reviews': 13, 'num_type_reviews': 7, 'id': '0B6CAC43BDE8391359AEE09D5C2B1787', 'location': 'Santiago, Chile'}",,93346,0,2012-09-29,141570558,False,3.0,"“Bien ubicado pero muy ruidoso” No es un hotel barato

“excellent location”,"My husband and I took a long weekend to San Antonio and stayed in this hotel. We were not so happy having to settle for a smoking room, but were told that was what we had reserved and they didn't have anymore nonsmoking. They really cleaned it and tried to get the smoke out, so that was ok. Beds could be more comfortable. They squeak and have bumps. Other than that, we had a good time. Enjoyed the kitchen, liked the couch and coffee table. The breakfast bar was good, with a variety of drinks and breakfast items. Liked the location.","{'username': 'stinnett', 'num_reviews': 7, 'num_cities': 3, 'id': '6C2D8DB9A8874B700AA963EE3569E437', 'location': ''}",,223230,0,2012-08-20,137831201,False,4.0,"“excellent location” My husband and I took a long weekend to San Antonio and stayed in this hotel.

“Dump”,I would not recommend this place. The heater did not work. The safety lock for the room was broken. The walls showed signs of rough plastering. The refrigerator did not work. Linens and overall cleanliness was just not consistent with a room of this price.
