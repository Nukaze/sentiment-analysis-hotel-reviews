Great Location!”,"I just spent two nights at the Hampton Inn and was impressed with how clean the hotel was. The staff is very friendly and helpful. The hallways are tight, but the rooms are nice amd clean. My only complaint is that the walls are very thin. The complementary breakfast is great, probably one of the best varieties I've seen in awhile. I would stay at this hotel again in a heartbeat.","{'username': 'Mymy808', 'num_cities': 6, 'num_helpful_votes': 8, 'num_reviews': 8, 'num_type_reviews': 3, 'id': '139D40CBD39F82E87FAB303D0CDAE5A4', 'location': 'Alexandria, Virginia'}",2012-06-01,268216,1,2012-06-09,131616689,False,4.0

Top notch service!”,We stay at the Sheraton Chicago Hotel and Towers whenever we travel to downtown Chicago (2-3 times per year). Close to shopping and easy access to the Convention center.

Fabulous location for all purposes”,"The staff, amenities, and location continue to make the Kitano one of our favorite quality stays while in New York for business or pleasure.

Be sure to check out their off season specials and promotions.

Front Desk
Most staff members are friendly - but may I say a bit more smile from the front desk staff would make every thing better. I once called the front desk and I could hear the 'sigh' from the other end when he picked up the phone. Even though my issue was solved but seriously, people could hear whether the other party is smiling or not through the phone. Or may be I might just need to accept that the quality of service would be slightly discounted if I got a great deal from Hotwire/Priceline.
Shower area only has room for one person - compared to the spacious room, this is disproportionately small! There was one night when there was a jet of water shot out from the shower and hit right above the shower glass door to the wall outside. This made the toilet paper all soaked and I had been glad that this did not ruin the TV speaker. But there was already a pond of water right outside the shower area. 
(But I like the TV speaker feature in the toilet - quite interesting! but it would be great to include the monitor as well - they might take reference from the Four Seasons in Hong Kong!)
Room Choice:
Since I booked this hotel through priceline, even though I have then joined their Select Guest program, I was not assigned to the King Bed room that I preferred. I had to call the next day to check but luckily I got to be transfered to another room on the same floor.
Double room - smaller bathroom area: there was not enough space around the sink for 2 people's stuff. 
King room - bigger bathroom area: other than this, every thing else was the same.
Be careful if you take snack from the mini bar as some of them are expired... 
TV
As a 4-star hotel, it is really a wonder why the TV set is still CRT but not LCD. I've stayed in several Asian hotels (both small local and big international 3-4 star) and all of them had LCD TV in their rooms!! I don't understand why this is not the same in the states from the three 3-4 star hotels that I've stayed in in recent years. LCD TV makes the room looks much much much bigger without this huge CRT set in the middle of the room and it makes the whole in-room design style more modern, isn't it?
Gym
The gym room is very good - well-equipped with towels and water. Though several things could be improved:
1) might be good to add a Smith machine
2) might be better if the weight intervals of a machine could be smaller - more accomodating for females
3) fit balls need to be checked regularly as it felt like air has been leaking and dusty throughout
Valet
Closest parking to the hotel and more than 1 block away. So we chose to park out car through valet - which is $30 per day. With this rate, we expected pretty highly from the hotel. There was once that it took more than 15 min to retrieve our car during one afternoon where the staff did not appear to be on top of every thing's going on at that moment. And there was a big cloud of flies at the waiting area in the entrance!! Quite disgusting...
One of the managers, though, was able to pick up my dissatisfaction and offered to take at least a night's valet charge off my bill - which is done more than what I expected!
Final Tip:
If you booked this hotel through Hotwire/Priceline, be sure you've tipped enough.","{'username': 'SKW66', 'num_cities': 7, 'num_helpful_votes': 6, 'num_reviews': 22, 'num_type_reviews': 9, 'id': 'BC9FA51D11AA3EE3223493D23927AD3A', 'location': 'Hong Kong, China'}",2009-05-01,77804,1,2009-05-30,31176255,False,4.0
