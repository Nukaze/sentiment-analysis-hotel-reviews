{'overall': 5.0},“We Are Impressed!”,We agree with the other people when it comes to this place! My aunt and uncle live in texas so we all head to san antonio whenever we visit texas. You feel like your in another country san antonio is a beautiful place with lots of history like the Alamo is here. The westin is a great location right on the riverwalk with restaurants and shopping all around you and at night everything is all lit up and be sure to take the boat right. The westin rooms are nice size and decorated nicely the food is good and the staff was helpful.,"{'username': 'christy31', 'num_cities': 15, 'num_helpful_votes': 199, 'num_reviews': 60, 'num_type_reviews': 19, 'id': '69D54221CB6E10CD86EE264FE26EAA6E', 'location': 'Portsmouth, Ohio'}",,99535,2,2004-10-26,2787505,False

I loved it each time. Despite technically being a 'medium,' both rooms were small (as should be expected for New York). However, it was dark and quiet, which is exactly what I want out of a hotel in NYC. 
The bar is one of my favorites in the City (and serves as a great work space during the day), the Breslin was delicious, the room was clean at all times and the staff was helpful enough (though by no means effusive). My only complaint was that there weren't a lot of late-night food options within walking distance (pizza!?!?)... but that can easily be worked around.
All in all, the Ace is one of my favorite places to stay in NYC.","{'username': 'KristaNyc', 'num_cities': 11, 'num_helpful_votes': 10, 'num_reviews': 11, 'num_type_reviews': 11, 'id': 'D8EA5888D75113DFE98BA83485E25D0D', 'location': 'NYC'}",December 2010,1201072,0,2011-11-18,120757647,False

- good downtown location, especially if you're in philly for business.
- awesome views of the harbor if you stay on a high-enough floor.
- really cool seafood restaurant downstairs
- good, knowledgeable staff for a large hotel and in a city where this is rare","{'username': 'brennaena', 'num_cities': 3, 'num_helpful_votes': 4, 'num_reviews': 3, 'num_type_reviews': 3, 'id': '7BCE1202BA14D1E5A4F3A5A507940B67', 'location': 'chicago'}",June 2008,112132,0,2008-10-20,21038564,False

Pros:
- Excellent front desk service and response to requests from my room
- Gorgeous decor

- Rate went up $100 / night from Friday night to Saturday night","{'username': 'KMacWilson', 'num_cities': 4, 'num_helpful_votes': 4, 'num_reviews': 4, 'num_type_reviews': 3, 'id': 'F434FA49840F218EE86907E3246888E9', 'location': 'Fort Mill, South Carolina'}",October 2012,122014,0,2012-10-10,142472880,False
