The location was perfect, the room was clean and well appointed and the bathroom must have just been redone, because it was great. We had the atrium view, which means we looked at a brick wall, but we were only in the room at night so it didn't matter. We will stay there again.","{'username': 'Christine95746', 'num_reviews': 2, 'id': '8941D9872359F9E7613D1E0CBED0B0EF', 'location': 'Granite Bay, California'}",August 2012,94367,0,2012-09-11,140022071,False
"{'cleanliness': 3.0, 'value': 3.0, 'overall': 2.0, 'rooms': 3.0, 'service': 2.0}",“Hotel room was fair”,"Stayed four nights in August (16-19). Older hotel and the rooms & hallways showed it. No 'fridge in room as expected; vending & ice machines in the 14-floor tower were only on two floors. Private beach was a plus; public beach crowded and dirty. The concierge went above & beyond for us in resolving an issue with a hot air balloon company and seemed to go out of his way to ensure all guests were taken care of in a respectful manner. 
We were originally given a room right across from the elavator on the 7th floor and after looking at the room, asked for a different location. The desk staff had no problem in finding us a different room on the 10th floor. This room was the last one on the floor and housekeeping never seemed to clean it before 3 pm which caused a few problems. We'd leave for the day around 9am and returned in the afternoon to a dirty room.
We ate breakfast at the resturant and the service and food were outstanding. I don't think I'd stay out on Mission Bay again; LaJolla was nicer and quieter and I would recommend staying there if possible, and if you're a couple with no children.
Even thought the pool area was nice and large; THE WATER WAS FREEZING!!!!! So most everyone laid around the pool, but no one was swimming. A few brave kids were in the water, but not long. Had to pay for parking in their ramp, but at least the car was secure. Steps out of the ramp were a problem for luggage; no ramps available to roll suitcase to and from the hotel grounds.
Pretty decent place in all; I'd give it a B.","{'username': 'JulieIN54', 'num_cities': 12, 'num_helpful_votes': 22, 'num_reviews': 22, 'num_type_reviews': 7, 'id': '40C059BFC6455B566B13C767047A6F5C', 'location': 'Lafayette, Indiana'}",August 2004,79971,3,2004-09-07,2516998,False

"{'cleanliness': 3.0, 'value': 4.0, 'overall': 4.0, 'rooms': 2.0, 'service': 4.0}",“L'Enfant Plaza Hotel - good choice”,"My husband and I have just returned from a week's trip to DC and Williamsburg - we stayed at the L'Enfant while in the city and it was a good choice for us. We took the 5A bus from Dulles for only $3.00 (thanks to a tip from the tripadvisor DC forum!) to L'Enfant Plaza Station - the final bus stop is about 1/2 block from the hotel entrance. The hotel is very near the Mall and Smithsonian and we were able to walk there easily. For destinations further away, the metro station is right under the hotel. On the floor above the metro is The Promenade, with many shops and cafes. Most are open only during weekday business hours, but Oh's Chinese restaurant and the smaller Oh's cafe across the hall are open extended hours. The hotel's positives: the entire staff was unfailingly polite and helpful; check-in was quick and efficient; and our room on the 12th floor had a fabulous view of the Potomac. The only negative was that the room was in need of redecoration, everything in it was worn and/or stained. The hotel restaurants are a bit high priced (typical of full service hotels) but we ate there several times and the food was good each time. We can hardly wait to visit DC again and get to all the places we didn't have time to see. We'll certainly stay at the L'Enfant again.","{'username': '', 'id': '', 'location': ''}",October 2005,84081,3,2005-10-06,3996909,False
{'overall': 4.0},“Great Location”,"Stayed here July 24-27 and as many reviewers have already stated the location is perfect for its location to the museums. We traveled the town via Metro system which was ideal for us. Rooms were clean, A/C a bit noisy, but then again you aren't there to sit in the rooms all day. Didn't have too much interaction with the staff, but what little we had was very pleasant. Tour desk downstairs sells tickets for the trolley which gets you around the town very easily. Unlimited on and offs for each day purchased.
Ate dinner in Foggy Bottom one night at Tony and Joes. Ambiance was very nice but prices were too high for the quality of food received. There is no childrens menu.
Getting access to the free computers downstairs was a task, fortunately we were able to access the internet via our wireless Sprint card. Had great cellphone access in the area with Sprint.
Food downstairs is mediocre. Ate pizza twice (we have 3 kids) and at the museums. Went out to the mall in Pentagon City via the Metro. 
Overall would be willing to stay here again once their renovations were complete.","{'username': '', 'id': '', 'location': ''}",,84074,3,2004-08-01,2349309,False
