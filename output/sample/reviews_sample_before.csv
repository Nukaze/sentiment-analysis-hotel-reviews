Needs some repairs with paint etc. Not bad but was there 2 yrs ago and needed some TLC then too. Make sure your reservation $$$$ match what you see looking up the room. Still waiting for manager to call back. Not sure I would stay again with so many other hotels in the area.,"{'username': '', 'id': '', 'location': ''}",June 2012,88442,0,2012-06-12,131849395,False

But it was fantastic. The staff we're friendly, helpful and professional. The room, despite being right next to the elevator (which usually prevents sleep for me) was extremely quiet and spotless. The bed was extremely comfy. We had dinner in the restaurant three nights. The setting is impressive to say the least and the food was first class, as was the service. Couldn't find fault and would definitely go back.","{'username': 'smurfette72', 'num_cities': 6, 'num_helpful_votes': 4, 'num_reviews': 7, 'num_type_reviews': 5, 'id': '862DC0B4078B5AD5A52C3550B504F3C8', 'location': 'durham'}",March 2011,81397,1,2011-04-11,103611138,False

We agree with the consensus of T.A, reviewers; this is a very good hotel--not great, not average.
Here's what we experienced:
PARKING:The options are valet parking, self-service parking, and very limited street parking. We selected self-service parking at $13 per day plus tax. We've never paid for parking at a hotel before and considered this excessive and unwarranted. Also, it took more time to park our car than we ever expected.
SERVICE: Freindly, respectful, as you would expect of a high-end hotel. But the woman who registered us treated us as objects tio be processed--not sensate humans. Having the door opened for us every time we came or left was a nice touch. The time it took to have our room made up ach day was egregious; the maid service was always late. One day, my wife called at 3:30 PM, asking for our room to be made up.(And this was not unique to us: Our daughter staying on the same floor (#11) had the same problem.)
ROOM: A good size and comfortable but a tad bit small for a high-end hotel. We needed another straight-back chair. The king-sized bed was comfortable, and I slept well all three nights.Good insulation in walls, but we definitely heard doors closing. Street noise was a problem, even on the 11th floor.
BATHROOM: Good, with a very good shower. Be careful: the water in the shower and at the sink is really hot. Unfortunately, the bath towels are quite thin.
BREAKFAST:Our options were: room service, restaurant (these first two options are expensive), Starbucks (near elevator on first floor), or bring your own (as we did. We're vegans so we brought soy yogurt and a little ice chest (no refrigerator at this hotel).
NEWSPAPERS: A couple of newspapers are available gratis each day in the lobby area (such as USA Today, Wall Street Journal and Daily News).
GUEST LAUNDRY ROOM: Yes, bring coins.
FITNESS CENTER: Wonderful! There are 4 treadmills, 2 exercise bikes, 2 ellipticals, a StairMaster, 7 weight machines (5 upper body and 2 leg)--all this equipment is Precor Plus they have free-standing weight and weight benches. (There's more, but this is all that I can remember.)
OUTDOOR AND INDOOR POOL AND SPA: Very nice. The pools are large enough for exercise but not Olympic size.
MAP: Ask for a map showing restaurants and markets at reception. It's a wonderfully useful map.","{'username': 'VeganChela', 'num_cities': 34, 'num_helpful_votes': 41, 'num_reviews': 38, 'num_type_reviews': 35, 'id': '17754E6708A232A800D6D7723432421A', 'location': 'Sacramento, CA'}",June 2012,82689,2,2012-06-06,131442097,False
