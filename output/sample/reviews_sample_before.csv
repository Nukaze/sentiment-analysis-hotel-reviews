From the time I made the reservation with Len Regan until I checked out early Monday morning, I was treated like a valued customer. Len upgraded me to a suite without any prompting on my part. He provided excellent, concise directions to public transportation as well as provided a coupon for a Trolley Tour of the city. The Lamplighter, while an older hotel, is very well maintained and super clean. It's third generation American family owned. The landscaping is lush, the breakfast is more than a continental and very tasty. The team spirit among the employees and staff was most noticeable. I observed an array of elderly folks who seem to be frequent guests and discovered many have been coming for two to three month stays for many years. There are good restaurants within walking distance. All in all, I would highly recommend this Best Western.","{'username': 'lcromer', 'num_reviews': 2, 'num_cities': 2, 'id': '42F5F0A855A4606A272DF462665B2024', 'location': 'Belleair, Florida'}",January 2011,81352,0,2011-01-27,94689134,False
"{'cleanliness': 5.0, 'sleep_quality': 5.0, 'overall': 4.0, 'value': 5.0, 'service': 4.0}","“Great hotel, centrally located.”","We stayed here for 7 nights in August 2011, and really enjoyed the hotel.
The rooms are a good size, there is plenty of closet space, and a big dresser for all your clothes.
The bathroom was an okay size, with a great counter for your stuff. And most important of all it was spotless clean.
We didn't really use any of the hotel services, only when we ordered a cab for the airport, and they made sure we got that on time.","{'username': 'Mhjort', 'num_cities': 3, 'num_helpful_votes': 1, 'num_reviews': 4, 'num_type_reviews': 3, 'id': '68FB184FD79D4409BC18F18E82F8EA3D', 'location': 'Aalborg, Denmark'}",August 2011,112347,0,2011-09-01,117523260,False
{'overall': 1.0},“Un film dell'orrore!”,"Ci sono stata tanti anni fa con un'amica. Leggendo le recensioni vedo che non è cambiato nulla. Pensate che con la mia amica ancora raccontiamo in giro quanto ci è accaduto là dentro.
E' proprio il caso di dire: ""Non aprite quella porta!!!""
Abbiamo passato una settimana a cambiare stanza, ma tanto era inutile. Vi dico solo che, tra le innumerevoli cose, ci siamo ritrovate un topo in stanza e...dulcis in fundo...l'ultima sera ci hanno fatto evacuare (solo a noi due) per un falso incendio, con tanto di pompieri. Sembra un film, invece è tutto vero.
Tralascio le condizioni igieniche, che tanto ne hanno parlato gli altri prima di me.
Per carità, non ci andate!","{'username': 'harlRoma', 'num_reviews': 1, 'id': '4E24DAA9F3B2F0F0369CF070DD43F408', 'location': 'roma', 'num_helpful_votes': 2}",May 2003,93421,2,2008-08-08,18756792,False

(Great Price too!)”,"Beautiful hotel from the outside. Inside, the hotel is even better. The decorators definitely do not shop at the same suppliers as most of the hotels I have been in. The hotel is clean and a great price. This hotel is pretty new, (only a couple years old i think) and everything is in perfect condition. The beds are comfy, and the large shower is great. The hardwood floors add a nice touch to the whole flavor of the rooms. 
The location is good for a business person with close proximity to many businesses in Jacksonville's Southside area. The location is also close to a HUGE Tinseltown Movie theatre, dozens of restaurants (There are a couple REALLY nice restaurants within walking distance).
Overall, this is one of the nicest hotels I have ever stayed in. It has all of the qualities look for in a hotel. (Decent price, super clean, and isn't decorated with furniture from the 70's)","{'username': 'tvoytko', 'num_cities': 4, 'num_helpful_votes': 2, 'num_reviews': 4, 'num_type_reviews': 4, 'id': '15E87FF9DCE7DDEB76983DECD4ED34BB', 'location': 'Macclenny, FL'}",December 2012,1214730,0,2012-12-10,147110845,False

Big mistake! Showed up in the lobby paid for the room. Once we got up to the room it was a dump. I would let my dog sleep there. This place is the biggest dump that I have seen EVER! Went to a friends room at the Weston tried to find another room in the city couldn't was going to sleep on the floor in our friends room. Called Kings Inn tried to get our money back after half hour and wouldn't give a refund. Called AAA which recommend then place on a whim since everything else was sold out in town. They told AAA there we that we sleep in the bed and used the shower. We spend 3 minutes in the room and left didn't even take our things up too the room.
